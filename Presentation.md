Hello! My name is Vladislav and today I will tell you about **Canvas API**.

Canvas was initially introduced by Apple for use in their own Mac OS X WebKit component in 2004, 
powering applications like Dashboard widgets and the Safari browser. 
V3C proposed canvas as a standard.

And so what is the canvas ? 
Canvas is a set of APIs for creating and managing graphics, 
usually in Javascript. Canvas allows you to place on canvas:
- Picture
- Video
- Text
- Fill it all with solid color, or circle the contours or even add a gradient.
- Drawing shapes using control points (moreover, you can change both the width of the lines
 and the brush for drawing lines or the style of connecting lines).


The canvas element is part of HTML5 and allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes 
and bitmap images.
It is a low level, procedural model that updates a bitmap and does not have a built-in scene graph;

HTML5 Canvas also helps in making : 
- 2D games.
- WEB application.
- animated graphics.

Canvas is also widely supported by modern browsers such a Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer,
Safari, Konqueror, Opera and Microsoft Edge.

Example canvas element on html page 
The following code creates a Canvas element in an HTML page:
This code draws a red rectangle on the screen.

Features:
- High performance when rendering any 2D objects.
- Changing the height or width of the canvas will erase all content and all settings, in other words, it will be created anew.
- The reference point 0,0 is located in the upper left corner. But it can be changed.
- There is no 3D context.
- Text color and font size can be specified in the same way as in CSS.
- Canvas is best suited for creating raster graphics (for example, in games, fractals, etc.), editing images and operations that require manipulation at the pixel level.

Disadvantages:
- Rendering based on pixels.
- Weak text rendering capabilities.
- HTML 5 Canvas is not suitable for creating websites or web application interfaces, since user interfaces usually need to be dynamic and interactive, and Canvas requires you to constantly redraw each element in the interface.
- There is no API for animation. You will have to resort to using timers and other events to update the canvas.
- It loads the processor and RAM
- low performance at high resolution
- you have to draw each element separately

So . With Canvas, we can create many different applications of game animations and many other cool things.

Thank you for your attention. That's all I wanted to tell.
